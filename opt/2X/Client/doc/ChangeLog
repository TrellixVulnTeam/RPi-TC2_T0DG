* Wed Aug 02 2006 - geoffrey@2x.com

-	Replaced old appserverclient binary with the new version 0.99.1120

* Fri Jul 07 2006 - geoffrey@2x.com

-	install.sh
	-	Added header tag to include new function install_binary_links.
	-	Now creating a link in /usr/local/bin to application server binary.
	-	Added error checks.
-	scripts_library.sh
	-	Added function return_tool_path that searches through an array of paths
		for a given tool and if found, returns the full path to the tool.
	-	Added function remove_dirs which removes all directories passed in an
		array.  A test is done to verify that the passed directory paths are
		valid directories.
	-	Added function install_binary_links responsible for creating links
		for binary files.
	-	Added function uninstall_binary_links which removes links to specified
		binary files.
	-	Both remove_and_update_ldsoconf and add_and_update_ldsoconf functions
		have been modified to take advantage of the new return_tool_path function.
	-	The get_installation_dir function was extensively modified.  The function 
		now will try to determine the exact installation path using up to three methods.
		Method 1 involves checking the current path, method 2 investigates if it can 
		fetch the information required from the /proc directory, and the final method 
		involves the use of the find command. Each test is carried after the previous
		one has failed.
-	postinstall.sh
	-	Added header tag to include new function install_binary_links.
	-	Now creating a link in /usr/local/bin for the appserverclient binary.
-	postuninstall.sh
	-	Added header tags for functions uninstall_binary_links and remove_dirs.
	-	The script removes the link created by the postinstall.sh.
-	linker.sh
	-	Fixed two bugs that were breaking the linking process.  The first bug
		became evident when two function tags where included in the same function.
		Due to the fact that the index of the tag array was being initialized in
		the wrong place was having the effect that only the last tag was being
		remembered.  In the second bug the linker was not checking whether the 
		function in question had already been included in the current pass.
-       ChangeLog
        -       Added the ChangeLog file to both rpm and tar-bz.
-       ApplicationServerClient.spec
        -       Updated rpm spec file by adding the Vendor tag.
-       build_appserver_client_linux.sh
        -       Inserted code to include the ChangeLog file in both rpm spec
                file and in the tar-bz archive.  This should help the user
		to follow changes in the product.

* Mon Jul 03 2006 - geoffrey@2x.com

-	Replaced old appserverclient binary with the new version 0.99.1107

* Tue May 23 2006 - geoffrey@2x.com

-	EULA.txt
	-	Added the license for the application server client.
-	README
	-	Merged the INSTALL document with the original README.
-	install.sh
	-	All functions are now being linked during tar-bz building.
-	scripts_library.sh
	-	Added more functions to this library.  Other functions have been re-written and simplified.
-	postinstall.sh/postuninstall.sh
	-	Some functions have been renamed in the scripts_library.sh and therefore the associated tags
		have been modified.
-	build_appserver_client_linux.sh
	-	Added functionality such that the same script can build both rpm and the tar-bz.  Is is achieved 
		through switches on the command line.  By default the script builds an rpm from trunk.
-	linker.sh
	-	Removed the sed script asa it was not working properly.
	-	Now script can resolve nested function inclusions and conflicts.
	-	Erroneous tags are marked as such so that the user can resolve the problem before linking again.

* Fri May 19 2006 - geoffrey@2x.com

-	install.sh
	- This is the script that is shipped with the tar-bz archive and is responsible to create the necessary links
	  and update the ld.so.conf configuration file.
-	scripts_library.sh
	- This script contains the common functions used by both postinstall.sh and postuninstall.sh scripts.
	  These functions will change and others added to cover the tar-bz install, uninstall scripts.
-	linker.sh
	- This script decodes tags of the form #<libraray name-->function name> in scripts and replaces the tag with
	  the appropriate function from the specified library.  At the moment it also handles recursive tags ie.
	  the included function can itself have a tag and so on.  Further work is expected to resolve certain bugs
	  and include more features.
-	postinstall.sh/postuninstall.sh
	- These scripts have been modified by removing the common functions and inserting tags instead to take advantage
	  of the linker.sh script.
-	build_appserver_client_linux.sh
	-  Resolved some small bugs as well as taking advantage of the linker script to build the postinstall/postuninstall
	   scripts on the fly. Will add functionality to build the tar-bz.

* Tue May 16 2006 - geoffrey@2x.com

-	Modified build version in the README file
-	Added the doc directory that is meant to store all related documentation

-	Added ApplicationServerClient.spec which is the spec file to build the Application Client for Linux RPM.
-	Added build_appserver_client_linux.sh which is the build script to build the rpm and tar gz versions.  
	-	At the moment only the rpm function works and more work needs to be done.
-	postinstall.sh/postuninstall.sh are the scripts that are included in the spec file that builds the RPM.
	-	These scripts perform the final settings when installing and un-installing.
-	Added library libstlport.so.5.0.1 that is required by the appserverclient binary.
-	Added the appserverclient binary version 0.99.1007
