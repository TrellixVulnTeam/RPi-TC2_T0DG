The following examples illustrate the use of this client

1) appserverclient -s<Server IP> -a<"Application Name"> -u<User Name>
   appserverclient -s192.168.0.1 -a"Internet Explorer" -uAdministrator
In this case you are requested to logon before the application is loaded.

2) appserverclient -s<Server IP> -a<"Application Name"> -u<User Name> -p<Password>
