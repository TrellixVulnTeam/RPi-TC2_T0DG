  Prevent further pmounts of <device> until it is unlocked again. <pid>
  specifies the process id the lock holds for. This allows to lock a device
  by several independent processes and avoids indefinite locks of crashed
  processes (nonexistant pids are cleaned before attempting a mount).

 %s --unlock <device> <pid>
  Remove the lock on <device> for process <pid> again.
